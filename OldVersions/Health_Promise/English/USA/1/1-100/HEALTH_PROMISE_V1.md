# Health promise

This is another one of my attempts at writing open source health software to help take care of people, including myself. Each individual software package I write serves its own purpose. The software will not be discontinued without a 100% proper replacement and plenty of time for anyone to migrate.

This software is designed to help monitor your health, but it won't help you with your health entirely. You still need to feed yourself, drink, take a bath/shower, etc. on your own. This software simply serves as a visual reminder on when to do so.

This software will not replace [Self-Care bot](github.com/seanpm2001/Self-care_bot) as the 2 packages serve different purposes in different ways.

I hope that this software can help as many people as possible. This software should not cause any pain or death by itself.
